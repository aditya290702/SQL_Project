AID00001,P00001,"Several pathways related to immune regulation and inflammation are dysregulated. Key mechanisms involve aberrant activation of mucosal immune cells, such as T lymphocytes and macrophages, leading to excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β. Additionally, dysfunctions in mucosal barrier integrity and immune tolerance mechanisms contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue damage in the colon."
AID00002,P00002,"
In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there's a dysregulation in Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation. Th1 responses are often overactive, leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-gamma, contributing to tissue damage. Th2 responses may be insufficient, impacting regulatory mechanisms and potentially exacerbating the autoimmune response against myelin in the central nervous system."
AID00002,P00003,"
Th17 cell differentiation is heightened. This results in an increased production of interleukin-17 (IL-17), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Th17 cells play a significant role in promoting inflammation and tissue damage within the central nervous system, contributing to the pathogenesis and progression of MS."
AID00002,P00004,"In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), dysregulation of antigen presentation occurs when myelin-derived antigens are presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the central nervous system, leading to activation of autoreactive T cells. This triggers an immune attack on myelin, contributing to the inflammatory demyelination characteristic of MS pathology."
AID00002,P00005,"
In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), dysregulation of T-cell activation occurs due to aberrant T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and dysfunctional interactions with self-antigens presented by MHC molecules. Altered costimulatory molecule expression, like CD28/B7, exacerbates inflammation, leading to autoimmune attack on myelin and the central nervous system."
AID00002,P00006,"In Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome (APS), dysregulation primarily affects immune tolerance mechanisms, leading to the production of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells targeting multiple endocrine organs. Defects in immune checkpoints and central tolerance mechanisms contribute to the autoimmune damage observed in APS."
AID00003,P00003,"
Th17 cell differentiation is heightened. This results in an increased production of interleukin-17 (IL-17), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Th17 cells play a significant role in promoting inflammation and tissue damage within the central nervous system, contributing to the pathogenesis and progression of MS."
AID00003,P00007,"In autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS), the chemokine signaling pathway is dysregulated, disrupting immune cell trafficking, altering cellular responses like migration and adhesion, and leading to abnormal activation of downstream pathways. These disruptions contribute to autoimmune reactions against endocrine tissues, highlighting the role of chemokine signaling in APS pathogenesis."
AID00003,P00008,
AID00004,P00009,"In Type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple immune pathways undergo dysregulation, culminating in the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. Firstly, there's dysregulation in antigen presentation, where beta-cell proteins are incorrectly recognized as antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to activation of autoreactive T cells. Subsequently, dysfunctions in T cell regulation occur, with a shift towards a pro-inflammatory Th1 cell response, marked by increased production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. This results in the activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and macrophages, which mediate the destruction of beta cells through direct cytotoxicity and inflammatory mediators. Additionally, defects in regulatory T cell function contribute to immune dysregulation in T1D. These collective dysfunctions underscore the complex interplay of immune pathways in the pathogenesis of T1D."
AID00005,P00010,"Alopecia areata is characterized by dysregulation in systemic type 17 and type 2 cytokines, which may contribute to disease-associated psychological morbidity
. This dysregulation involves an imbalance in the production of cytokines such as IL-33, IL-31, and IL-17E (IL-25), as well as IL-17A, IL-21, IL-23, and IL-17F, leading to an overactive type 17 immune response and an underactive type 2 response"
AID00005,P00011,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is dysregulated in alopecia areata. Specifically, the expression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) is altered, which can inhibit hair growth and the telogen-to-anagen transition"
