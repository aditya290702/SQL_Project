P00001,Inflammatory bowel disease - Homo sapiens (human),"	
map05321","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), involves chronic gastrointestinal tract inflammation triggered by genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and dysregulated immune responses. Environmental elements, notably the luminal environment surrounding epithelial cells, play a critical role. Pathogens increasingly found in IBD can activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), initiating NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation. NOD2 mutations reduce negative regulation of IL-12, exacerbating CD. APCs also direct T cell differentiation, with Th1 and Th17 cells promoting CD through IFN-gamma and IL-17, while Th2 cells, along with NKT cells, induce UC via IL-4, -5, -10, and IL-13.",https://www.genome.jp/pathway/map05321
P00002,Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation,map04658  ,"
Different types of microorganisms trigger distinct immune responses regulated by specialized T helper (Th) cell lineages. Naive CD4+ cells differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells under the influence of antigen presenting cells (APCs). Th1 cells, marked by T-bet and STAT4, produce IFN-gamma, promoting cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. Conversely, Th2 cells, driven by GATA-3 and STAT6, secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, vital for combating parasitic helminths and facilitating humoral immunity, including IgG1 and IgE production. Imbalances in Th1/Th2 subsets can lead to allergic reactions or autoimmunity, underscoring the significance of their regulation in disease susceptibility.",https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa04658+H01490
P00003,Th17 cell differentiation,"
map04659","Th17 cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells, play a role in combating extracellular microbes and contributing to autoimmune diseases. Their formation involves activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) by TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-1, IL-23, and IL-21, leading to STAT3, ROR(gamma)t, and other factors upregulation in CD4+ T cells. This prompts the production of IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22. Negative regulation by IL-2, IL-4, IL-27, and IFN-gamma through STAT5, STAT6, and STAT1 activation hinders Th17 differentiation and IL-17 expression. Retinoic acid and IL-2 with TGF-beta stimulate Foxp3, which suppresses cytokines like IL-17 and IL-21. Fine-tuning Th17 differentiation prevents excessive inflammation, crucial for balanced immunity.",https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa04659+H01490
P00004,Antigen processing and presentation,map04612,"
Antigen processing and presentation in humans involve a complex molecular pathway crucial for immune surveillance and response. Antigens are internalized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via endocytosis or phagocytosis. Within APCs, antigens undergo proteolytic degradation into smaller peptides within endosomes or lysosomes. These peptides then bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, forming MHC-peptide complexes. These complexes are transported to the cell surface, where they are displayed for recognition by T cells. CD4+ T cells interact with MHC class II-peptide complexes, while CD8+ T cells recognize MHC class I-peptide complexes, initiating adaptive immune responses against pathogens or abnormal cells.",https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa04612+H01490
P00005,T cell receptor signaling pathway,"	
map04660  ","Effective immune responses rely on activating T lymphocytes, a process initiated by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory molecules like CD28. When the TCR binds to a foreign antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules, and CD28 interacts with B7.1/B7.2 receptors, signaling cascades ensue. These cascades involve various proteins such as tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, GTP-binding proteins, and adaptor proteins. They orchestrate T-cell proliferation, cytokine release, and differentiation into effector cells. This complex interplay regulates both general and specialized functions essential for mounting an appropriate immune response against pathogens or abnormal cells.",
P00006,Primary immunodeficiency,map05340,"
Primary immunodeficiencies (PIs) encompass a diverse range of conditions impacting cellular and humoral immunity, as well as non-specific host defense mechanisms involving complement proteins, phagocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. These disorders heighten susceptibility to infections, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies. Most PIs stem from genetic abnormalities affecting cell maturation or function within hematopoiesis. Cellular immunodeficiencies, affecting T cells or both T and B cells, represent 20% of PIs, while humoral immune disorders, impairing B-cell differentiation and antibody production, constitute 70%. These variations underscore the complexity of PIs, arising from disruptions across different stages of immune system development and function.",https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa05340+H01725
P00007, Chemokine signaling pathway - Homo sapiens (human),map04062,"
Inflammatory immune responses rely on recruiting leukocytes to sites of inflammation, facilitated by chemokines, small chemoattractant peptides guiding cell trafficking. Chemokines also regulate hematopoietic cell activation, differentiation, and survival. Chemokine receptors, G-protein coupled receptors on immune cells, transduce chemokine signals. Upon activation, G protein subunits dissociate to trigger downstream pathways, inducing cellular polarization and actin reorganization via small GTPases. Chemokine signaling regulates nitric oxide induction and reactive oxygen species production through calcium mobilization and diacylglycerol production. This intricate system orchestrates immune cell recruitment and activation, pivotal for effective host defense and inflammatory responses.",
P00008,Necroptosis - Homo sapiens (human),map04217,"
Necroptosis, a programmed form of cell death, can be triggered by various stimuli like tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TRAIL, FasL, IFN, LPS, and viral nucleic acids. It relies on the kinase activity of RIPK1 and RIPK3. The process involves ROS generation, calcium overload, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, mitochondrial fission, inflammatory responses, and chromatinolysis. Necroptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, retinal diseases, acute kidney injury, inflammatory conditions, and microbial infections. This regulated cell death mechanism underscores its significance in diverse disease processes across different organ systems.",https://www.kegg.jp/pathway/hsa04217+H00107

Type I diabetes mellitus",map04940       ,"Type I diabetes mellitus stems from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells. Beta-cell proteins act as autoantigens post-processing by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like macrophages and dendritic cells, presenting them with MHC-II molecules. Activated CD4+ Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFNgamma, activating macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. These effectors may kill beta-cells via direct interactions with MHC-I-bound autoantigens or via non-specific inflammatory mediators. Type I diabetes is polygenic, with mutant MHC-II alleles and the insulin gene being key determinants.

Cytokines are essential soluble proteins or glycoproteins that regulate and coordinate intercellular activities, including innate and adaptive inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. They are secreted by diverse cell types in response to various stimuli, exerting their effects by binding to specific receptors on target cell surfaces. Cytokines are categorized into different families based on their structural similarities, and their receptors are similarly grouped. This intricate network of cytokine signaling plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis by orchestrating cellular responses to physiological and pathological stimuli throughout the body.""",https://www.genome.jp/pathway/mmu04060+77125

Wnt proteins, secreted morphogens vital for development, regulate cell fate, progenitor-cell proliferation, and asymmetric cell division across species and organs. Three Wnt pathways exist: canonical, planar cell polarity (PCP), and Wnt/Ca2+. In the canonical pathway, Wnt binding to its receptor stabilizes cytoplasmic beta-catenin by inhibiting its degradation complex, allowing it to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes with TCF transcription factors and coactivators. PCP signaling activates RHOA and RAC1 GTPases, triggering JNK and ROCK, leading to cytoskeletal remodeling and altered cell adhesion/motility. Wnt/Ca2+ signaling, mediated via G proteins and phospholipases, induces transient calcium increases activating PKC, CAMKII, and calcineurin.",https://www.genome.jp/pathway/map04310
